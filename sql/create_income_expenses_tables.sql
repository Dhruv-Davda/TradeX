-- Create Income and Expenses Tables for Trade Manager
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Create income table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS income (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()::text,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  user_email TEXT NOT NULL, -- For shared data across devices
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  payment_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (payment_type IN ('cash', 'bank_transfer', 'upi', 'cheque')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- 2. Create expenses table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS expenses (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()::text,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  user_email TEXT NOT NULL, -- For shared data across devices
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  payment_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (payment_type IN ('cash', 'bank_transfer', 'upi', 'cheque')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- 3. Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE income ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE expenses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Create RLS policies for income table (email-based for shared data)
